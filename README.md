[00:21.11] Time to shine and I'm down to ride
[00:23.32] I'm gonna drive until the break of dawn, wilding out
[00:26.09] I'm on a mission grinding out, whatever it is I gotta do
[00:28.57] Riding out until the day I meet you, I'm riding out
[00:54.07] 
[00:31.25] I look up in the sky (sky)
[00:32.65] Asking lotta, why? (Why?)
[00:33.71] But never let it phase me, I'm keeping good vibes
[00:36.15] When I'm on the road, watch out for all surprises
[00:38.60] What it provides us
[00:39.68] Good and bad but nothing unties us
[00:56.68] 
[00:41.06] Another wander in the night
[00:43.98] Let me paint the view
[00:46.64] Color a town with my light
[00:50.18] For every moment shared with you
[00:51.92] Not out in the day
[00:54.05] But never fully gone
[00:56.46] Going to be back again
[00:59.91] Until the coming of a dawn
[01:12.91] 
[01:01.85] (Hey) for all the days ahead of us put your hands up
[01:04.85] Wave 'em side to side for good luck, ah
[01:06.93] (Hey) for all the nights like this, put your hands up
[01:10.18] Love the moment even from dusk, yup
[01:12.34] (Hey) you always got my back, and of course I got your back
[01:15.29] Don't you worry about that now
[01:17.12] (Hey) it's been a good day, good night
[01:19.54] It's gonna be a good day, good night
[01:37.54] 
[01:42.08] Two hands meet at zenith
[01:44.75] Nothing comes between us
[01:47.13] Dancing like ballerinas
[01:49.03] Under, the moonlight all night long
[01:52.38] How these plain and simple scenes
[01:54.45] Get painted so vividly by you
[01:59.25] I just wanna stay with you
[02:12.25] 
[02:01.97] Around the world I slowly dance
[02:04.82] Whenever our eyes meet
[02:07.01] You know you leave me in a trance
[02:10.71] It means everything to me
[02:12.64] Looking down below
[02:14.76] The one I seek to find
[02:16.92] No matter where you might go
[02:20.82] Remember you'll be on my mind
[02:35.32] 
[02:23.03] (Hey) always watching over me somehow you make me feel invincible
[02:26.21] Power to my soul, yup
[02:27.87] (Hey) I'm at ease with things that used to bother me
[02:30.52] 'Cause your existence just lights me up, yup
[02:33.13] (Hey) you always got my back, and of course I got your back
[02:36.13] Don't you worry about that now
[02:38.18] (Hey) it's been a good day, good night
[02:40.36] It's gonna be a good day, good night
[02:58.36] 
[02:42.29] Within the inner heart I plead
[02:45.14] For you to talk to me
[02:47.39] I wanna hear all the good and bad
[02:50.27] The new stories you have
[02:52.58] As I drift across the sky
[02:55.38] The hour hand turns high
[02:57.20] So goodnight
[02:59.83] Let me sing a lullaby, love
[03:06.77] I'll be seeing you, baby
